How to build OpenCV with Contributions for iOS:
- cd into a directory where you clone opencv and opencv_contrib
- Clone OpenCV with: git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv.git
- Clone OpenCV Contributions with: git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_contrib.git
- Open CMake GUI Application.
  - Set the source code path to the top-level opencv folder
  - Set the build path to .../opencv/build (it will create the folder)
  - Type "extra" in the search field to find OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH and set it to the opencv_contrib/modules folder
  - Press Configure
  - Press Generate
- open a terminal and cd to opencv/platforms/ios/
  - chmod +x build_framework.py
  - if you want to reduce the framework size, remove unneeded architectures at line 199 of build_framework.py (currently only arm64 is built)
  - run ./build_framework.py --opencv ../.. --contrib ../../../opencv_contrib ./build
  - the result will be saved in the folder build/opencv2.framework
