How to build OpenCV with Contributions for iOS:
- cd into a directory where you clone opencv and opencv_contrib
- Clone OpenCV with: git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv.git
- Clone OpenCV Contributions with: git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_contrib.git
- Open CMake GUI Application.
  - Set the source code path to the top-level opencv folder
  - Set the build path to .../opencv/build (it will create the folder)
  - Type "extra" in the search field to find OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH and set it to the opencv_contrib/modules folder
  - Press Configure
  - Press Generate
- open a terminal and cd to opencv/platforms/ios/
  - You must have cmake installed for the terminal (e.g. with sudo port install cmake)
  - Copy the files build_framework_release.py and build_framework_debug.py into the opencv/platforms/ folder
  - run ./build_framework_release.py --opencv ../.. --contrib ../../../opencv_contrib --without matlab ./build_release
  - run ./build_framework_debug.py --opencv ../.. --contrib ../../../opencv_contrib --without matlab ./build_debug

- the single lib files will be saved in the folder build_{config}/build/build-arm64-iphoneos/lib/{config}

- Copy all *.a files opencv/platforms/ios/build_{config}/build-arm64-iphoneos/lib/{config} to SLProject/_lib/prebuilt/OpenCV/ios/{config}
- Copy all files from the folder opencv/platforms/ios/build_{config}/install/include to SLProject/lib_SLExternal/opencv/include
